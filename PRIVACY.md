## What We Collect

### Anonymous Usage Data
We use [PostHog](https://posthog.com) to understand how people use our extension. This helps us fix bugs and improve features.

**What's tracked:**
- Pages visited on our website
- Which buttons are clicked
- Download counts and story metadata (title, author, story ID)
- Errors that occur
- Basic device info (browser type, screen size)

**What's NOT tracked:**
- Your name or email
- Your reading habits
- Anything that identifies you personally

**Why we track story downloads:**
We track which stories are downloaded (title, author, ID) to understand popular content and potentially cache frequently requested stories to make the extension faster. This data is anonymous and not linked to you personally.

### Cookies
We use a small cookie to track anonymous sessions. This helps us count unique visitors without knowing who you are.

## What We Don't Do
- ❌ Sell your data
- ❌ Share data with third parties (except PostHog for analytics)
- ❌ Track what fanfics you read or download
- ❌ Store any files on our servers (downloads go straight to your device)

## Your Rights
- **Opt out of tracking:** Use an ad blocker like uBlock Origin, or disable JavaScript
- **Delete data:** Since we don't collect personal data, there's nothing to delete
- **Questions:** Open an issue on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthropics/fanficDownloader)
